		<p class="main-title standout">The healthcare industry is a tricky space. How can we deliver the help that people desire in a way that is affordable, accurate and adoptable?</p>
		<p class="summary">Going into this project, my team and I quickly discovered that seniors were an under-supported segment across almost all industries. Meaning that a lot of products aren't designed with seniors in mind - such as apps, tools or hardware. After some research, we discovered that falls resulting from poor balance was a leading cause of senior deaths and injury. However, most seniors are not aware of balance issues and how it could impact their life - until it's often too late.</p>

		<p class="inside-title">Senior products are expensive & word of mouth is the way to go.</p>

		<p class="inner-para">Following the Price Sensitiy Meter technique, our team was able to determine a reasonable price of $300-400 for our soles and app, taking into accountability of COGS and labour. Although arbitrary, this value meant that we could target 2 of the 3 senior spenders - and ensured that our product was more accessible than other smart insole products on the market.</p>

Fall-conscious seniors are those who have not fallen, but are proactive in preventing falls. Post-fall seniors are individuals who have fallen. We defined seniors as individuals who are around 60+ years old. </p>
		<p class="inner-para">The other segments we uncovered where recovering patients, who would benefit from using a tool like Smart Soles. Lifestyle optmizers are on the younger individuals (40s-50s) who are into health and fitness, and would like to reduce the effects of aging as much as possible.</p>
		<p class="inner-par reframe">We decided to focus on fall-conscious seniors, as this group had the strongest incentive to use Smart Soles, and it would be acceptable for their lifestyle.</p>
