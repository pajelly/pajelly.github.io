					<p class="section-title" id="section2">The challenge.</p>
					<p class="text">Over the last few years, Jennifer had been thinking about opening her own fitness training business after several requests from friends and family, and has decided that this was the year to begin it.</p>

					<p class="text">My team and I had no experience with creating a fitness website, nor any idea on how to create a brand.</p>

					<p class="big-goal break">But basically, our goal was to create a dynamic informational site from scratch.</p>

					<p class="goal-title">Business goals:</p>
					<p class="text">1. A dynamic, easy to maintain site where information about her services could be easily discovered, updated, and understood.</p>
					<p class="text break-bottom">2. Allow clients to contact Jennifer directly (by program guidelines, we were not liable to set up an e-commerce website)</p>

					<p class="text">To further help us understand what other fitness trainers offered, we looked at several sites (some examples <a href="https://carmelrodriguez.com/" class="internal-link">here</a>, <a href="https://www.jillianmichaels.com/" class="internal-link">here</a> and <a href="https://www.tammyhembrow.org/" class="internal-link">here</a>) for competitive analysis and to gain insight into the fitness industry.</p>

				<div class="content-insights">
					<p class="section-title break-top" id="section3">The discovery.</p>

					<p class="text">To inform our design and development decisions, we conducted an initial survey to inquire users on what they thought about personal training and what they would like to see on a site offering fitness services. We gained insights from 21 random individuals between the ages of 20-30, and some of them were being parents.</p>

					<p class="text">This was the target age range that Jennifer was aiming for, as she wanted to show young adults and parents that it is possible to maintain both a healthy lifestyle and or/whilst raising a family.</p>

					<p class="text">Our results informed us of several things:</p>

					<img src="assets/webdev/forte-needs.jpg" alt="project-img" class="support-img">

					<p class="text">Other common comments included:</p>
					<p class="text">- personal training was too expensive!<br>
						- want to see the trainer as friendly and approachable<br>
						- health was not a high priority in people's current lifestyles<br>
						- would only consider a personal trainer if people cannot get the information or specific routine themselves<br>
					</p>

					<!-- <p class="text">When we asked potential users to reflect on what would interest them in actively seeking out a personal trainer or training services, many of them pointed out that:</p> -->

					<!-- <img src="assets/webdev/forte-explain.jpg" alt="project-img" class="support-img"> -->

					<p class="text break">The primary goal for Jennifer's site was to display her services, and offer a way of contact for clients to reach her. Knowing this, we began with a <b class="showshow">content-first approach</b> in creating her product.</p>

				</div><!-- end of content-insights -->

				<div class="content-reframe">
					<p class="section-title" id="section4">The creation.</p>
					<p class="text">To ensure brand consistency, the team decided to create a moodboard and style guide to ensure a cohesive brand impact for the client.</p>

					<p class="text caption">You might have noticed that this moodboard does not match the branding material shown in this case study, but is reflective of the <a href="http://www.jenniferrhfitness.com/" class="internal-link">actual website</a></p>

					<p class="text caption">Hmm... our original style guide...</p>




					<p class="text break"><span class="marked">Looking back, I think we could have spent more time on researching cohesive colour palettes and design styles so that her brand was more modern and unique. In addition, I think we could have been more assertive in suggesting recommendations, as we ended with colours that did not necessary work with the black and grey colour palette.</span></p>

					<p class="text">As with a content-first approach, we also created an information architecture to guide our WordPress files and directories.</p>

					<!-- <p class="text">IA here</p> -->

					<p class="text">After the IA was finalized, we ran through several iterations of the website layout. In hindsight, we should have started with a mobile-first design because we ended up with a lot of code changes trying to re-adjust for the mobile platform...</p>

					<p class="text">Once the mockup designs were approved with Jennifer, we went ahead with development. We created a custom WordPress site using a starter theme, creating our own taxonomies and hierarchies. Having a Wordpress site would allow Jennifer the flexibility to change and manager her content as her business grew and changed.</p>

					<p class="section-title">And Deliverables.</p>
					<p class="text">After the site was developed on our local sites, it was time to hand it off to the client on her own hosting site.</p>

					<p class="text">Well, transferring the content from server to server was kind of really stressful, and took much longer than we had initially thought... but that sums up our one-month capstone project!</p>

					<p class="section-title" id="section7">Reflections & Going Forward</p>
					<p class="text">In the end, there were several things I still would have liked to have changed if allowed the time and if our design/development skills were stronger.</p>

					<p class="text">While the starter theme set up a solid base for us to create the site, we faced other issues that we did not expect. The biggest challenge was actually working cohesively and productively as a team. Of course, this led to some poor communication, which resulted in poor code and rushed timelines.</p>

					<p class="text">Another problem was getting past the learning curve for unfamiliar software. For this project, we styled the site using SASS and utilized GULP to automate our development workflow. And then we ran into merge conflicts and that was another ordeal LOL. </p>

					<p class="text">But we rebounded from this by adapting the scrum framework, which really helped us get through our mess.</p>

					<p class="text">All in all, I am immensely proud of my team and I for creating our first ever 'proper' website! (quality and aesthetics is debatable okay) It gave us a chance to see what a front-end developer does on a daily basis as well as what freelance work might be like.</p>


					<img src="assets/webdev/office-yeah.gif" alt="project-img" class="support-img break-top">

					<p class="text caption">Woohoo!</p>

				
					<p class="text break-top">Moving forward, it would have been great if we could have upgraded Jennifer's branding and website, as well as make our code even more effective and simplified. In addition, it would have been really valuable to see our SEO metrics from Google Analytics and apply other forms of digital marketing to further push her site!</p>

					<p class="section-title">The challenge.</p>
					<p class="text">So the issue of fake news is complicated for a lot of reasons, such as:</p>

					<ul class="points-made">
						<li>Facebook’s current algorithms are designed to show posts that are catered to the user, creating an “echo chamber”; basically you tend to see content related to points of view similar to yourself</li>
						<li>Many fake news posts are made with the intent of economic profit (think ads or how to get max number of clicks) which is a timeless motivation?</li>
						<span class="emphasize-point"><li>Perception of credibility is complex</li></span>
						<li>With more content on the web, it's becoming difficult to trust the media</li>
						<li>Users want to determine the credibility of information they encounter on their own</li>
						<li>Differences in digital literacy between generations</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text">Now a lot of those reasons might sound like common sense, but remember that Mayan calender craze. That didn't make any sense, but it totally exploded across the internet.</p>

					<!-- <img src="assets/fakenews/meme-oreo.png" class="project-img">

					<p class="text">So how exactly does fake news spread?</p> 

					<p class="text">Well, asides from <span class="under-line">appealing to our emotions</span> through strong language, graphic images, and positive or negative hype, etc., fake news spreads because of <span class="under-line">why they were created in the first place - to facilitate social and personal sharing</span> through personal networks. In addition, people tend to use <span class="under-line">shortcuts and heuristics</span> when judging news posts, with a lack of critical thinking and analysis.</p>
