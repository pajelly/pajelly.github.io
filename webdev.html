					<p class="section-title">The discovery.</p>

					<p class="text">To inform our design and development decisions, we conducted an initial survey to inquire users on what they thought about personal training and what they would like to see on a site offering fitness services. We gained insights from 21 random individuals between the ages of 20-30, and some of them were being parents.</p>

					<p class="text">This was the target age range that Jennifer was aiming for, as she wanted to show young adults and parents that it is possible to maintain both a healthy lifestyle and or/whilst raising a family.</p>

					<p class="text">Our results informed us of several things:</p>

					<img src="assets/webdev/forte-needs.jpg" alt="project-img" class="support-img">

					<p class="text">When we asked potential users to reflect on what would interest them in actively seeking out a personal trainer or training services, many of them pointed out that:</p>

					<p class="text">The primary goal for Jennifer's site was to display her services, and offer a way of contact for clients to reach her. Knowing this, we began with a <b class="showshow">content-first approach</b> in creating her product.</p>

					<p class="text">Looking back, I think we could have spent more time on researching cohesive colour palettes and design styles so that her brand was more modern and unique. In addition, I think we could have been more assertive in suggesting recommendations, as we ended with an outlier colour that does not necessary work with the black and grey colour palette.</p>

					<p class="section-title">The challenge.</p>
					<p class="text">So the issue of fake news is complicated for a lot of reasons, such as:</p>

					<ul class="points-made">
						<li>Facebook’s current algorithms are designed to show posts that are catered to the user, creating an “echo chamber”; basically you tend to see content related to points of view similar to yourself</li>
						<li>Many fake news posts are made with the intent of economic profit (think ads or how to get max number of clicks) which is a timeless motivation?</li>
						<span class="emphasize-point"><li>Perception of credibility is complex</li></span>
						<li>With more content on the web, it's becoming difficult to trust the media</li>
						<li>Users want to determine the credibility of information they encounter on their own</li>
						<li>Differences in digital literacy between generations</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="text">Now a lot of those reasons might sound like common sense, but remember that Mayan calender craze. That didn't make any sense, but it totally exploded across the internet.</p>

					<!-- <img src="assets/fakenews/meme-oreo.png" class="project-img">

					<p class="text">So how exactly does fake news spread?</p> 

					<p class="text">Well, asides from <span class="under-line">appealing to our emotions</span> through strong language, graphic images, and positive or negative hype, etc., fake news spreads because of <span class="under-line">why they were created in the first place - to facilitate social and personal sharing</span> through personal networks. In addition, people tend to use <span class="under-line">shortcuts and heuristics</span> when judging news posts, with a lack of critical thinking and analysis.</p>
