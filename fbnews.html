					<p class="section-title" id="section2">The Problem.</p>

					<p class="text highlight"><span class="">Facebook users are susceptible to fake news - regardless of demographics eg. age, education, political preference, etc. This is partially due to the large amount of information available and is projected to the users.
					</span></p>

					<p class="text">The issue of fake news on Facebook is complicated for a lot of reasons, but I've summed it down to these 4 key insights.</p>

					<img src="assets/fakenews/wider-fb.jpg" alt="project-img" class="reason-img">

					<!-- <p class="text highlight break"><span class=""> 
					</span></p> -->

					<!-- <img src="assets/fakenews/fb-meme.png" class="project-img">

					<p class="text caption">Remember when the world was suppose to end in 2012... and global warming is real...</p> -->

					<!-- <p class="text">Fake news is created with the intent to damage or influence some type of event, agency, or persons for personal, financial or political gains. Or for mischief, ‘trolling’, or attention-seeking. Often times, it’s spread because fake news is difficult to distinguish from factual news, and people genuinely mistaken fake news as something real.
					</p> -->

				

					<p class="text highlight"><span class="marked">This creates a heavy cognitive load, so how can we help solve this?</span></p>

			<!-- end of content-start -->

				<div class="content-discovery break-top">
					<p class="section-title" id="section3">The Exploration.</p>

					<p class="text">I asked users ranging from 20 - 40 years old about their thoughts on fake news on Facebook, and Facebook's current design solutions for this issue.</p>

					<p class="text">Let’s take a look at Facebook’s current designs in combating fake news. </p>

					<img src="assets/fakenews/current-fb.jpg" alt="project-img" class="reason-img">

					<p class="text">When I asked users about the button, these lines stood out:</p>

					<p class="text highlight">-- I only clicked on that information button once.
					</p>

					<p class="text highlight">-- Oh, I didn’t even notice the information button, I thought it was for an ad or something!
					</p>

					<p class="text highlight">-- <span class="marked">What does this information mean though?</span> It doesn’t really help me to understand the post in relations to other context or perspectives… nor does it provide relevant, related information.
					</p>

					<p class="text">For the purpose of this case study, I will be <b>focusing on the user experience of articles on Facebook Newsfeed and optimizing the information button.</b></p>

					

				</div><!-- end of content-discovery -->

				<div class="content-reframe break-top" id="nittygritty">
					<p class="section-title" id="section4">The Redesigns.</p>
					<p class="text">With this in mind, I approached my redesigns with 3 main ideas:</p>

					<p class="goal-title small-break">Goal: A practical and intentional 'get informed' experience</p>

					<p class="text indent hit">a. Story Context</p>
					<p class="text indent hit">b. Smart Recs</p>
					<p class="text indent hit small-break">c. Past Read Insights</p>


				</div><!-- end of content-reframe -->

				<div class="content-creation">

					<p class="text highlight">It’s clear that fake news can be hard to distinguish for any user. However, it’s not Facebook’s place to determine what is considered fake news, which leaves a lot of ambiguity and work to the viewer of the article.</p>

					<p class="text highlight"><span class="marked">How can we reduce cognitive overload and ease information processing in a neutral and intuitive manner?</span></p>

					<p class="section-title break-top" id="section6">Redesign 01 - Story Context</p>

					<p class="text">In this case, I propose that increased friction can be a solution to <span class="marked">help induce critical analysis in users, and actually reduce friction</span> in information processing.</p>

					<div class="prototype">

					<div class="prototype-text">
					<p class="text highlight break-top"><b>Story Context:</b> a brief slideshow overlay with critical details is displayed over the article image on auto-scroll.<br><br> This interaction is triggered by viewport position and hover duration over the article.</span></p>
					</div>

					<video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="video-container">
				  		<source src="assets/fakenews/oreos.mov" type="video/mp4">
				  	</video>

				  	</div>

				  	<p class="text caption">“It takes more information to make you believe something you don’t want to believe than something you do” <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/05/alternative-facts" class="internal-link">APA Fact Check</a></p>

				  	<img src="assets/fakenews/story-context.jpg" alt="project-img" class="reason-img">

					<p class="text">I choose a moving slideshow so that users are aware of the changing information on their screens, even if they were not initially paying attention to it.</p>

					<p class="text">Again, the purpose of this forced friction experience is to <b>strongly suggest</b> users to pay more attention to critical, useful elements of the post for the purpose of combating fake news.</p>

					<p class="text highlight">It’s probably not possible to make everyone critical thinkers, but we can <span class="marked">make the process of analysing information easier, and to do so in a neutral manner.</span></p>

					<p class="section-title break-top" id="section7">Redesign 02 - Smart Recs</p>

					<p class="text">Now, I think that Facebook’s ‘information button’ is a pretty powerful tool for providing users with more contextual information. I just think that it’s not being optimized to its best potential.</p>

					<img src="assets/fakenews/smart-recs.jpg" alt="project-img" class="reason-img">

					<p class="text">I decided to keep with the bubble-esque effect that is currently in use for some of Facebook’s content.</p>

					<p class="section-title ">* People's opinions:</p>

					<p class="text">When I was exploring Facebook Newsfeed and Pages + Groups, I noticed that there was an ‘opinions’ section when you search for certain key terms eg. Trump. It appears that this section is what other Facebook users are talking about connected to that specific key term or topic. 
					</p>

					<img src="assets/fakenews/fb-opinions.jpg" alt="project-img" class="reason-img">

					<!-- <span class="content-img content-span op-says"></span> -->

					<p class="text caption">I've never seen this before until now</p>

					<p class="text">However, one critique of this is that it actually may not helpful because some users may post offensive or biased opinions. Furthermore, it might just show the perspectives of users that <b>actually post things on their walls</b>, which is not reflective of all opinions about a topic.</p>

					<div class="prototype">

					<div class="prototype-text">

					<p class="text highlight break-top talking"><b>Potential solution:</b> a live, public discourse space where Facebook posts made by politicians, influencers or other types of agencies are shared instead of people's opinions.</p>
					</div>

					<video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="video-container">

				  	<p class="section-title break-top" id="section8">Redesign 03 - Past Read Insights</p>

				  	<div class="prototype">

				  	<div class="prototype-text break-top">

				  	<p class="text">I think it might be helpful if Facebook automatically compiles articles that you’ve been <b><span class="under-line">reading (or even been exposed to)</span></b>, and sets a space where you can see (compare) what articles other people are reading.</p>

				  	<p class="text highlight">The purpose of this space to provide insights and opinions from different demographics (outside of your echo chamber).</p>

				  	</div>

				  	

				  	<img src="assets/fakenews/fb-compare-analysis.jpg" class="project-img history">

				  	</div>

					<p class="text">This concept was inspired by The Wall Street Journal's <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/" class="internal-link">Red Feed, Blue Feed</a>. Although their project presents a very striking comparison of Facebook posts between liberals and conservatives, one constraint this is presentation is: who determines the range of political standing?</p>

					<p class="text highlight break-top">Ultimately, I believe a better focus is to gently encourage users to <span class="marked"><b>critically analyze</b></span> by easing the way information is presented on Facebook Newsfeed.</p>

					<p class="text highlight">Not only does this encourage better critical thinking for combatting fake news, <span class="marked"><b>these potential solutions will make it harder for fake content to pass as real news</b></span>.</p>

				<div class="content-reflection">
					<p class="section-title break-top" id="section9">Going Forward.</p>

					<p class="text">Through this exploration, it has taught me to be careful of the subtle nuances in UX design, for example, how do you present information to users without being pushy? (eg. so that they don't leave one platform for another) Or allow the users to feel like they are in control of the information they are exposed to online in an unbiased way?</p>

					<p class="text highlight">As a result of this project, I've come to understand that <span class=" marked">many problems are universal and affect people everywhere</span> - and anyone with a desire to understand and use human empathy to solve these problems <b>can help solve them</b>.</p>

					<p class="text">Thanks for sticking it out to the end, I'll be updating this portfolio as fast as I can. Check back soon!</p>
