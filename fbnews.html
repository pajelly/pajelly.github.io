					<p class="section-title" id="section2">The Problem.</p>

					<p class="text highlight"><span class="">Facebook users are susceptible to fake news - regardless of demographics eg. age, education, political preference, etc. This is partially due to the large amount of information available and is projected to the users.
					</span></p>

					<p class="text">The issue of fake news on Facebook is complicated for a lot of reasons, but I've summed it down to these 4 key insights.</p>

					<img src="assets/fakenews/wider-fb.jpg" alt="project-img" class="reason-img">

					<!-- <p class="text highlight break"><span class=""> 
					</span></p> -->

					<!-- <img src="assets/fakenews/fb-meme.png" class="project-img">

					<p class="text caption">Remember when the world was suppose to end in 2012... and global warming is real...</p> -->

					<!-- <p class="text">Fake news is created with the intent to damage or influence some type of event, agency, or persons for personal, financial or political gains. Or for mischief, ‘trolling’, or attention-seeking. Often times, it’s spread because fake news is difficult to distinguish from factual news, and people genuinely mistaken fake news as something real.
					</p> -->

				

					<p class="text highlight"><span class="marked">This creates a heavy cognitive load, so how can we help solve this?</span></p>


				</div><!-- end of content-start -->
			</div>
			<!-- end of content-start -->

				<div class="content-discovery break-top">
					<p class="section-title" id="section3">The Exploration.</p>

					<p class="text">I asked users ranging from 20 - 40 years old about their thoughts on fake news on Facebook, and Facebook's current design solutions for this issue.</p>

					<p class="text">Let’s take a look at Facebook’s current designs in combating fake news. </p>

					<img src="assets/fakenews/current-fb.jpg" alt="project-img" class="reason-img">

					<p class="text">When I asked users about the button, these lines stood out:</p>

					<p class="text highlight">-- I only clicked on that information button once.
					</p>

					<p class="text highlight">-- Oh, I didn’t even notice the information button, I thought it was for an ad or something!
					</p>

					<p class="text highlight">-- <span class="marked">What does this information mean though?</span> It doesn’t really help me to understand the post in relations to other context or perspectives… nor does it provide relevant, related information.
					</p>

					<p class="text">As recent as <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/04/tackling-more-false-news-more-quickly/" class="internal-link">April 2019</a>, Facebook has taken several measures in combatting fake news asides from this design solution. Other solution interventions include academic analysis, manual review of posts and smart technologies to accurately target fake news for its removal.</p>

					<p class="text">For the purpose of this case study, I will be <b>focusing on the user experience of articles on Facebook Newsfeed and optimizing the information button.</b></p>

				<div class="content-reframe break-top" id="nittygritty">
					<p class="section-title" id="section4">Reframing the Problem.</p>
					<p class="text">With this in mind, I approached my redesign in 3 main steps:</p>

					<p class="goal-title small-break">Goal: A practical and straightward 'get informed' experience</p>

					<p class="text indent hit">a. Story Context</p>
					<p class="text indent hit">b. Smart Recs</p>
					<p class="text indent hit small-break">c. Past Read Insights</p>

					<p class="text highlight break-bottom">This is to solve the problem of reducing cognitive load and information processing, in order to encourage more critical analysis and awareness of fake news.
					</p>

					<!-- <p class="text">2. <b><span class="under-line">Community validation</span> (of information)</b></p> -->

					<!-- <p class="text indent">a. FB Group updates (think like an in-house twitter where verified groups can contribute to the conversation right there and then)</p>
					<p class="text indent break-bottom">b. Increase visibility and accessibility of opinions/goal-titleperspectives</p> -->

				</div><!-- end of content-reframe -->

				<div class="content-creation">
					<p class="section-title" id="section5">The Redesigns.</p>


					<p class="text">There's a spectrum of Facebook users, from those that only use it to message privately, share everything about their lives or do business online.</p>

					<img src="assets/fakenews/fb-share.png" alt="project-img" class="reason-img">

					<p class="text highlight">Regardless, it’s clear that not one user is resistant to fake news. However, it’s not Facebook’s place to determine what is considered fake news, which leaves a lot of ambiguity and work to the viewer of the article.</p>

					<p class="text">When people are overloaded with information, or do not care enough to critically analyze what they see, how can we make information processing and critical analysis easier?</p>

					<p class="section-title break-top" id="section6">Redesign 01 - Story Context</p>

					<p class="text">In this case, I propose that forced friction can be a solution to <span class="marked">help induce critical analysis in users, and actually reduce friction.</span></p>

					<div class="prototype">

					<div class="prototype-text">
					<p class="text highlight break-top"><b>Story Context:</b> a brief slideshow overlay with critical details is displayed over the article image on auto-scroll.<br><br> This interaction is triggered by viewport position and hover duration over the article.</span></p>
					</div>

					<video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="video-container">
				  		<source src="assets/fakenews/oreos.mov" type="video/mp4">
				  	</video>

				  	</div>

				  	<p class="text caption">“It takes more information to make you believe something you don’t want to believe than something you do” <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/05/alternative-facts" class="internal-link">APA Fact Check</a></p>

				  	<span class="content-img content-span redesign01 break-top"><img src="assets/fakenews/redesign1.jpg" alt="project-img" class="content-img"></span>

					<p class="text break-top explain">I choose a moving slideshow so that users are aware of the changing information on their screens, even if they were not initially paying attention to it. They can choose to manually flip to the page of the slideshow they want, or click onto the post to read more about it. </p>

					<p class="text highlight break">Again, the purpose of this forced friction experience is to <b>strongly suggest</b> users to pay more attention to critical, useful elements of the post for the purpose of combating fake news.<br><br> It’s probably not possible to make everyone critical thinkers, but we can make the process of analysing easier, and as neutral as possible.</p>

					<p class="section-title break-top" id="section7">Redesign 02 - Smart Recs</p>

					<p class="text">Now, I think that Facebook’s ‘information button’ is a pretty powerful tool for providing users with more contextual information. I just think that it’s not being optimized to its best potential, namely - the type of content that is displayed in the tab.</p>

					<div class="showme showdis break"><p class="text highlight shook desktop-soz"><a href="#nothing" class="showme no-link">Recall the current design for the information tab and some feedback I got from users for it. (hover me, sorry mobile viewers) <span><img src="assets/fakenews/fb-comments.jpg" alt="project-img poof" class="shownow"></p></a></span></div>

					<p class="text">This is an opportunity to provide information and articles from alternative perspectives and sources that is related to article on hand for a more neutral analysis.</p>

					<span class="content-img content-span redesign02"><img src="assets/fakenews/redesign2.jpg" alt="project-img" class="content-img"></span>

					<p class="text">I decided to keep with the bubble-esque effect that is currently in use for some of Facebook’s content after exploring Newsfeed.</p>

					<p class="text">I chose to display 3 related articles, all from different news sources, but the user has the option to view more. In terms of content for each bubble, I wanted to keep it straightforward so that it does not overwhelm the user.</p>

					<!-- REMAKE HERE -->

					<!-- <p class="text">When I asked users what would be helpful in helping them analyze whether an article was credible or not, many of them mentioned that they wanted to other sources report on the same topic. This is so that:
					<br>1. The topic is real and is confirmed through multiple sources 
					<br>2. There are varied reports on the same topic, which can provide a more neutral analysis 
					<br>3. Users are (suggested to be) open to other sources 
					</p> -->

					<p class="section-title ">* People's opinions:</p>

					<p class="text">When I was exploring Facebook Newsfeed and Pages + Groups, I noticed that there was an ‘opinions’ section when you search for certain key terms eg. Trump. It appears that this section is what other Facebook users are talking about connected to that specific key term or topic. 
					</p>

					<img src="assets/fakenews/fb-opinions.jpg" alt="project-img" class="reason-img">

					<!-- <span class="content-img content-span op-says"></span> -->

					<p class="text caption">I've never seen this before until now</p>

					<p class="text">I think is a pretty useful tool that should be integrated into the information tab, as it allows other users to see what people outside of their circles are saying.</p>

					<p class="text">However, one critique of this is that it actually is not helpful because some users may post offensive or biased opinions. Furthermore, it might just show the perspectives of users that just <b>actually post things on their walls</b>, which is not reflective of all opinions about a topic.</p>

					<p class="text">Instead, one solution to that could be live, public discourse space where Facebook posts made by politicians, influencers or other types of agencies are shared instead of people's opinions.</p>

					<video autoplay loop muted playsinline class="video-container">
				  		<source src="assets/fakenews/in-house-feed.mp4" type="video/mp4">
				  	</video>

				  	<p class="text caption">Let's see what the big people are saying</p>

				  	<p class="section-title break-top" id="section8">Redesign 03 - Past Read Insights</p>

				  	<p class="text">Another idea for this problem is to create a place for comparing and analysis. I think it might be helpful if Facebook automatically compiles articles that you’ve been <b><span class="under-line">reading (or even been exposed to)</span></b>, and sets a space where you can see (compare) what articles other people are reading.</p>

				  	<p class="text">The purpose of this space to provide insights and opinions from different demographics (outside of your echo chamber). Furthermore, it can help users become more aware of their current views and interests, but also suggest alternative views at the same time.</p>

				  	<p class="text">For current users, in order to see the feed of different pages and people means you have to follow them all. People often don’t want to do that because they do not want to clutter their feeds or reveal personal influences.</p>

				  	<img src="assets/fakenews/fb-compare-analysis.jpg" class="project-img history">

					<p class="text caption">I forget what I read all the time...</p>

					<p class="text">Depending on how effective this solution may be, simple filters such as categories can be applied to the articles so that users can quickly look for information. Doing this may help reduce the illusory effect (increased exposure to content = increased chance of accepting it as the truth).</p>

					<p class="text">This concept was inspired by The Wall Street Journal's <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed/" class="internal-link">Red Feed, Blue Feed</a>. Although their project presents a very striking comparison of Facebook posts between liberals and conservatives, one constraint this is presentation is: who determines the range of political standing?</p>

					<p class="text highlight break-top">Ultimately, I believe a better focus is to gently encourage users to <span class="under-line marked"><b>critically analyze</b></span> by easing the way information is presented on Facebook Newsfeed.</p>

					<p class="text highlight">Not only does this encourage better critical thinking for combatting fake news, <span class="under-line marked"><b>these potential solutions will make it harder for fake content to pass as real news</b></span>.</p>

				<!-- </div> -->
			<!-- end of content-creation -->

				<div class="content-reflection">
					<p class="section-title break-top" id="section9">Going Forward.</p>

					<p class="text">Through this exploration, it has taught me to be careful of the subtle nuances in UX design, for example, how do you present information to users without being pushy? (eg. so that they don't leave one platform for another) Or allow the users to feel like they are in control of the information they are exposed to online in an unbiased way?</p>

					<p class="text highlight break">As a result of this project, I've come to appreciate the research skills I've gained so far in uni, but more importantly, <span class=" marked">many problems are universal and affect people everywhere - and anyone with a desire to understand and use human empathy to solve these problems <b>can help solve them</b>.</span></p>
