					<p class="text">A deep-dive of literature and industry review revealed that senior falls are a growing problem as the world's aging population continues to increase. Moreover, there are little products on the market with a preventative approach to senior healthcare, as most products are reactive in nature eg. Life Alert (reactive as in seeking help or treatment once a fall has occured). While we understand that the deterioration of balance is often due to multiple factors eg. sensory loss, we are focusing on improving motor connections and consumer accessibility to personal health.</p>

					<p class="text">Consistent exercise and balance training has been shown to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2735075" class="linkme">reduce falls by 36%.</a>
					Market research suggests that the <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/319/100/wearables/worldwide#market-globalRevenue" class="linkme">wearable industry has been steadily increasing the past years</a>, and is projected to do so in the future as consumers shift to take control over their own health. We derived that the best form factor for a senior wearable could be an insole - as it is unintrusive, could used in most occasions, and is something that you could just set and forget.</p>

					<p class="text">The app got the job done and it was built using ReactNative. It also somewhat matches the initial design (close enough haha), but from this experience, I realized that the design was too vague and non-descriptive. For seniors, they often need breadcrumb cues to remind them of the navigation and intended use due to a reduced cognitive capacity. It also made me think more critically about the visual and UI design, and how I can design in a way that allowed customization and consistency.</p>
