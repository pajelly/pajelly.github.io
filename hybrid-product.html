  <ul>
    <li class="first-text">Of the ~50 seniors we spoke to, most of them are comfortable with technology and/or are comfortable seeking help to use them.</li>
    <li>Most of the senior fall prevention aids are reactive (eg. life alert once a fall has occured) and do not target the root causes of falls (eg. walking stick only temporarily helps the individual with balance).</li>
    <li>There is no follow-up or progress check method between each healthcare appointment.</li>
    <li>There are smart insoles that exist on the market, however - these are targeted towards performance level athletes and are unaffordable + inaccessible to the consumer market.</li>

    <p class="text">We chose an insole form factor because through our research, we found that seniors did not like wearing obvious wearables, and by using insoles - they can just set the device in their daily walking shoes and forget about it. We also wanted to integrate the opportunities from our research, such as using ML to help track, predict and recommend personalized interpretations for our users. Lastly, we observed that a huge gap between onboarding aging users to products was in its design, so we wanted to take a senior-first approach.</p>
