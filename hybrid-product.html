    <p class="text">Smart Soles was born out of a tech venture incubator capstone program, after discovering that falls are a leading cause of injuries and deaths in seniors.</p>
    <p class="text">As the product designer of the team, I touched on all aspects of the product from ideation to implementation for the hardware, software and business components of the entire product cycle.</p>

    <h1 style="font-weight: 800;">The context</h1>
  <div class="written">
    <p class="text">Did you know that in the United States, 1 senior dies every 19 minutes as a result of a fall? Key causes of falls include muscular deterioration, inactivity, and a lapse of accurate judgement. While other factors are also important in how balance is maintained (eg. sensory perception), we are focusing on improving physical health and consumer accessibility to personal health.</p>

    <p class="text">My team and I were able to conduct over 100+ interviews with users from this ecosystem, including: seniors, doctors, physiotherapists, adult children (30-50s years old) and grandchildren (<30 years old).</p>
    <p class="text">This allowed us to understand more holistically of the existing experiences, feelings and frustrations from all those involved in this ecosystem. It also allowed us to validate our product scope and user segments.</p>
