    <p class="text first-text">Did you know that in the United States, 1 senior dies every 19 minutes as a result of a fall? Key causes of falls include muscular deterioration, inactivity, and a lapse of accurate judgement. While other factors are also important in how balance is maintained (eg. sensory perception), we are focusing on improving physical health and consumer accessibility to personal health.</p>

      <p class="each">1)<b> Problem</p></b>
      <ul>
        <li>Falls are one of the leading causes of senior deaths and injuries worldwide.</li>
        <li>There are little products catered to seniors in the form of personalized consumer health.</li>
        <li>Aging individuals often have inaccurate judgements about their balance.</li>

    <div class="subsection">
      <p class="each">2)<b> Goal</p></b>
      <ul>
        <li>Design a product and app that allows seniors to track their balance dynamically over time, and suggests personalized exercises with live feedback.</li>
        <!-- <li>Ensure Smart Soles is a practical product that seniors would use and hold market feasibility.</li> -->
        <li>Increase local community interest and collaboration for our product launch.</li>

      <p class="each">3)<b> Action</p></b>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed our working MVP with hardware that could collect balance data, and send it to our ML algorithms for interpretation.</li>
        <li>Coded our companion app using ReactNative, which allows for product launch in both iOS and Android.</li>

        <li>Launched our working MVP for both the hardware and software!</li>
        <li>Won within top 35 at nwHacks 2020 (hackathon).</li>
        <li>Selected as the only Canadian team to compete at Hollomon Health Innovation Challenge 2020 in Seattle.</li>

This set the premise for a hardware and software integrated product, as we had engineers who could do both.

        <li>There is no follow-up or progress check method between each healthcare appointment.</li>
        <li>There are smart insoles that exist on the market, however - these are targeted towards performance level athletes and are unaffordable + inaccessible to the consumer market.</li>
