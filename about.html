						<!-- <p class="name">Hi (again), nice to meet you!</p> -->

						<p class="intro-text haha-key">Pajelly was the first internet name I came up with back in elementary school, cus I thought I was cool. (I'm not.)</p>
						
						<p class="intro-text break-top">So here's the deal.</p>

						<p class="intro-text">I'm Peijia, and I'm a student at UBC currently studying Cognitive Systems, with an emphasis on human-computer interaction. I got into design and technology after realizing I wanted to be in a creative industry, where I could contribute to making real products and understanding what people really wanted.</p>

						<p class="intro-text"><b>I see design as a way of solving problems holistically, by both making something enjoyable yet intuitive and functional to what the solution needs to be.</b></p>

						<p class="intro-text">In my free time, I somehow really enjoy watching bad reality TV on TLC or no-bake cheesecake making videos on youtube. Or sometimes I just sit around on a park bench and think. Is that weird?</p>

						<span>&#9786;</span> <span>&#9786;</span> <span>&#9786;</span>

						<p class="intro-text break-top-music">Music can say a lot about a person, so here's my current mood:</p>

						<!-- <p class="intro-text break-top">Let's work on some cool projects together!</b></p> -->

						<!-- <p class="intro-text">I entered university with a fixed mindset of doing something traditional like law or teaching, so I never gave much thought about the digital realm. However, I found myself leaning towards psychology and geography, because both involved understanding more about how we thought and how we interact with the environment + society.</p> -->

						<!-- <p class="intro-text">I then ended up in Cognitive Systems because it was so cool to see how we can apply knowledge from living systems, like how humans process information, to artificial systems - which was how I found UX design. Currently, I'm exploring graphic design, film photography and living with intentionality.</p> -->
					

						<!-- <p class="intro-text">Anyways, thanks for reading my story and say hi!</p>  -->

						<!-- <p class="intro-text">Wait, I'm not finished there's still stu-  -->
							

						<!-- <p class="intro-text">[my brain hurts from finishing this portfolio ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­]</p> -->
