<p class="summary">Through the replies from UBC and  secondary research, I know that campus operations are managed by many departments, such as: trades,  municipal services, custodial services, customer services and more. Each department takes care of different campus facilities and operations.</p>

<p class="summary">Maintenance workers are assigned to designated buildings/campus zones.</p>
<p class="summary">For this exercise, I will focus on designing an interface geared towards custodians. This means that requests made for a certain building/zone will fall under an assigned custodianâ€™s role. However, for different services, the interfaces will be altered appropriately  to reflect their specializations.

By keeping our school clean and maintained, we can re-allocate these funds to updating our swimming pool.) Rewards or prizes through the PWA can also be an additional incentive.</p>
