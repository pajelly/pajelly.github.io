				<p class="text">The Weekend Break is an Airbnb redesign project that aims to explore the concept of end-to-end travel. While many people enjoy the excitement of travelling, the planning and transportation process within travelling can be stressful and difficult.</p>
				<p class="text">The Weekend Break aims to reframe two common obstacles in travelling: time & money. This conceptual design aims to optimize the limited time that individuals have within a local context.</p>

				<div class="written">
					<p class="text">In many other trip planning apps, the process is determined by choosing the hotel and the transportation (eg. flights). Sometimes this process is separate or linear, such as Expedia. However, if you decide to change one of your choices, you have to go back to that previous step to restart your booking.</p>

					<p class="text"> I've also included an automated vehicle pick-up time range that works in conjunction with the estimated time of arrival. However, this is adjustable and pick-up times can be delayed by the user. This function was created to streamline the transportation process, and allow users to get to their Airbnb efficiently.</p>
