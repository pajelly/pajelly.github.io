<p class="summary">Why is that? What's the current interaction like between students and building management? If there was better communication and faciliation between the 2 parties, what are the consequences? First, it was important to understand exactly what problem I was solving for, why it's important and its project scope.</p>

<p class="summary">A quick brainstorm of the prompt allowed me to understand that I was designing for both the individuals reporting the issues, as well as the management resolving the issues. This led me to conduct interviews and surveys with both sides - campus-goers, and school operations/management.</p>
