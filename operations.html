<p class="main-title">A solution for building operations and school campuses</p>
<p class="summary">Managing building operations is an exploratory solution to the Google 2020 UX Design challenge this year. The proposed solution passed the challenge and made it to the project matching stage.</p>
<p class="summary">This design challenge is hypothetically built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), where students and campus-goers can communicate and report campus issues, in which the campus management can respond accordingly.</p>

<img src="assets/operations/breakdown.png" alt="project-img" class="img-right classic-bottom">

<p class="third-title">Most people don't care much about public facilities and maintenance because there's a lack of social accountability for shared spaces.</p>

<p class="summary">But what if thousands of $ dollars could be saved, and environmental damage reduced, if each of us took our part in maintaining campus facilities? That was an initial assumption I had, and it was important to understand exactly what problem I was solving for and its project scope.</p>

<img src="assets/operations/prompt-marked.png" alt="project-img" class="img-right classic-bottom">

<p class="summary">Breaking down the prompt allowed me to understand that I was designing for both the individuals reporting the issues, as well as the management resolving the issues. This led me to conduct interviews and surveys with both sides - students and faculty, as well as school operations and management.</p>
